The article that I chose talks a bit about the future of software engineering and what kind of direction it is heading towards. I thought it was pretty interesting because it includes a few topics that are growing tremendously and at a rapid pace during these past few years such as the rise of AI. I also feel that the rise of data science is also influencing the software development world as it's benefical to AI as well. It was also interesting to see that something such as remote work really only was put into consideration around the world because of a pandemic that we had which no one expected or saw coming.
